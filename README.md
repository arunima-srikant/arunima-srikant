### About Me  
I am an undergraduate student majoring in **Data Science and Economics** at FLAME University, Pune (Class of 2026). My academic journey has centered on **machine learning, artificial intelligence, and applied econometrics**, with hands-on experience across research, coursework, and internships.  

Some highlights of my work include:  
- **Deep Learning & Computer Vision**: Traffic sign recognition and domain generalization using CNNs, pretrained models, and domain generalization using a custom-trained Yolov8 model.  
- **Natural Language Processing**: Designed a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline with LlamaIndex during my data science internship.  
- **Machine Learning**: Classified a hidden dataset of Devanagari characters using a Random Forest, and achieving the highest test accuracy in the cohort.

Outside academics, I am a **trained Carnatic vocalist**, **self-taught guitarist**, and an enthusiastic **volleyball player and vice-captain** of my university’s women’s team.
